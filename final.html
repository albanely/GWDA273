  <p><center>
    In 1996, Premium Baked Goods Bakery opened its first location on a quiet street corner in the heart of New York City’s West Village. From its inception, Premium Baked Goods  Bakery has been cherished for its classic American baked goods, vintage decor and warm, inviting atmosphere.
   

In 2007, Premium Baked Goods  Bakery’s original owner passed her oven mitts to Steve and Tyra Abrams. Together, the Abrams’ have thoughtfully expanded the bakery from its first West Village shop to locations worldwide. Today, Premium Baked Goods  Bakery can be found in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Honolulu, Mexico City, Seoul, Tokyo, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Beirut, Kuwait City and Doha. For more information on Premium Baked Goods  Bakery’s locations. 
 
    In addition to our current locations, Premium Baked Goods  Bakery is continuing to franchise internationally and will soon open in Saudi Arabia and Brazil.

Patrons are also invited to place pickup orders for select products through our online store. We are also pleased to offer nationwide shipping for a variety of products, including freshly baked cupcakes, cookies, brownies and bars, as well as corporate gift packages and seasonal assortments.
